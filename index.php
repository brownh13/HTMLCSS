<h3 id="original">The Original Show</h3>

<p>
The original show aired from 1963-1989 and included the first 8 regenerations of the Doctor. It was originally meant to be an educational, family oriented show to explore
scientific ideas. But all that changed when they had to use a script, that was rejected by the head of the script department, involving aliens and Daleks because it was the 
only script ready to go. And the rest is history, so to speak. Though the show was cancelled after 8 seasons in 1989 due to lack of viewership.

<h3 id="reboot">The Reboot</h3>

<p> In 2005, with Russell T Davies as the writer, Doctor Who was on air once again. Since its inception there have 4 Doctors and every one of them has been a big hit.
BBC was even able to have Billie Piper, a British pop star, to play a companion. It has since gained international viewership and its very own fandom.
